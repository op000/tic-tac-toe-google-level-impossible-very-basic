# tic-tac-toe-google-level-impossible-very-basic

This is an AI based tic-tac-toe but it does not uses any special algorithm like back propogation, alpha-beta pruning, neural networks etc. It just uses some if-else statements and some while loops. 
Understanding the code is really beginner friendly and to play the game you need to write the slot number based on a graphic that shows on the extreme top left when the game starts. 
You need to type "s5" to place your symbol in the 5th slot. your number would be represented by a '1' and AI's number would be represented by a '2' and other unused slots by '0'.
Please enjoy the game and dont forget to use the file correct.py to play. You just need to go to the file then raw then download the file and run it on python 3.6+. you can find a list of libraries required to be installed in order to run this program in the requirements.txt file. Please make sure to install them first on your system using pop install 'library-name'.
